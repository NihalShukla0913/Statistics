Assuming that skin creams and drinking enough water reduces the risk of skin disease by 30% and prescription of a certain drug reduces its chance by 20%. At a time, a patient can choose any one of the two options with equal probabilities. It is given that after picking one of the options, the patient selected at random has the skin disease.
